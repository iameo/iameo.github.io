    "This is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. The way of setting up an object is really in the definitive example of say, OOP is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things; for instance, an object could represent a car with **properties** such as model, color and manufacture year, and **behavior** like accelerating, de-accelerating and opening doors.\n",
